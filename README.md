# BrowserPilot

> Ever wished you could tell your browser "Hey, go grab all the product prices from that e-commerce site" and it would just... do it? That's exactly what this does, but smarter.

## What's This All About?

Tired of writing complex scrapers that break every time a website changes its layout? Yeah, me too. 

This AI-powered browser actually *sees* web pages like you do. It doesn't care if Amazon redesigns their product pages or if LinkedIn adds new anti-bot measures. Just tell it what you want in plain English, and it figures out how to get it.

Think of it as having a really smart intern who never gets tired, never makes mistakes, and can handle any website you throw at them - even the ones with annoying CAPTCHAs.

## See It In Action

Trust me, it's pretty cool watching an AI navigate websites like a human

## Why You'll Love This

### It Actually "Sees" Websites
- Uses Google's Gemini AI to look at pages like you do
- Automatically figures out if it's looking at Amazon, LinkedIn, or your random blog
- Clicks the right buttons even when websites change their design
- Works on literally any website (yes, even the weird ones)

### Handles the Annoying Stuff
- Gets blocked by Cloudflare? No problem, switches proxies automatically
- Encounters a CAPTCHA? Solves it with AI vision
- Website thinks it's a bot? Laughs in artificial intelligence
- Proxy goes down? Switches to a backup faster than you can blink

### Gives You Data How You Want It
- Say "save as PDF" and boom, you get a PDF
- Ask for CSV and it structures everything perfectly
- Want JSON? It knows what you mean
- Organizes everything with timestamps and metadata (because details matter)

### Watch It Work Live
- Stream the browser view in real-time (it's oddly satisfying)
- Click and type remotely if you need to step in
- Multiple people can watch the same session
- Perfect for debugging or just showing off

## Getting Started (It's Actually Pretty Easy)

### What You'll Need
- Python 3.8 or newer (check with `python --version`)
- A Google AI API key (free to get, just sign up at ai.google.dev)
- Some proxies if you're planning to scrape heavily (optional but recommended)

### Let's Get This Running

1. **Grab the code**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ai-naymul/AI-Agent-Scraper.git
   cd ai-agentic-browser
   ```

2. **Install the good stuff**
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add your secrets**
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file (don't worry, it's gitignored)
   echo 'GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here' > .env
   echo 'SCRAPER_PROXIES=[{"server": "http://proxy1:port", "username": "user", "password": "pass"}]' >> .env
   ```

4. **Fire it up**
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
   ```

5. **See the magic**
   Open `http://localhost:8000` and start telling it what to do

## Real Examples (Because Everyone Loves Examples)

### Just Getting Started
```javascript
"Go to Hacker News and save the top stories as JSON"
```
That's it. Seriously. It'll figure out the rest.

### Shopping for Data
```javascript
"Search Amazon for wireless headphones under $100 and export the results to CSV"
```
It'll navigate, search, filter, and organize everything nicely for you.

### Social Media Intel
```javascript
"Go to LinkedIn, find AI engineers in San Francisco, and save their profiles"
```
Don't worry, it handles all the login prompts and infinite scroll nonsense.

### The Wild West
```javascript
"Visit this random e-commerce site and grab all the product prices"
```
Even works on sites you've never seen before. That's the beauty of AI vision.
